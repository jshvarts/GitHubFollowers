# About

The source code for this project is based on excellent Swift intro course by [Sean Allen](https://github.com/SAllen0400). If you are a new iOS developer looking to learn `UIKit`, I highly recommend this course at http://seanallen.teachable.com/

The app does not use any third party libraries and builds UI programmatically (no Storyboards)
